# Cat-AList

A sample solution for a programming challenge from AGL.

### Note:

- This is VS2017 solution that runs on .NET Core 2.0.
- It consists of a Console App, a .NET Standard Library and xUnit Test Projects.


### Background

The coding challenge is to build an app that consumes data from a JSON web service and outputs a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner. For example:

Male

  * Angel
  * Molly
  * Tigger

Female

  * Gizmo
  * Jasper
  * Notes

The app can be written in any language you like, using any libraries/frameworks/SDKs you choose.
Use of language features and/or libraries for grouping/sorting is encouraged. Eg: C# -> LINQ, Java8 -> Stream API, Javascript -> Lodash, Python -> List comprehension
Use of libraries for consumption of web services is encouraged. Eg: C# -> HttpClient, Java -> HttpClient, Javascript -> jQuery
Submissions which include tests will be looked upon more favourably.
